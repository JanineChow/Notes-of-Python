# Notes-of-Python
I came up with the idea of recording errors I confronted during my master thesis, because I always tend to find out the Meaning of things including coding.
I hope this notes are able to witness my progress in programming, english and german speaking.
From scratch, step by step, hope one day I will be proficient at python and communication. (that is definitely a pun, cause I currently study communication technology and also urge some improvement of communication skills)
